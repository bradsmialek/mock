What do we already know about functions?

why?

Reusability
Control
stability of our code
security
makes code easier to debugg
easy to share - libraries 

expect a function to do one task really well

input, process, output

function lindsey(a, b){
    code block
    return a + b;
};
code inside a function is encapsulation

scope  -  global, function or local

lindsey(4, 5); 

var hat = 5;

console.log(hat);
